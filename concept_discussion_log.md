# Discussion Log: Garden of the Sky Concept

**Status:** Creative Brainstorming / Definition Phase
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-21

## Core Concept: The Garden of the Sky (Taman Langit)
Reframing the entire application not just as a portfolio, but as a "cosmos" representing the author's inner self.
*   **Philosophy:** The app represents a place in the universe where the author resides.
*   **Metaphor:** Physical gardens representing abstract concepts (Time, Love, Knowledge, Identity).

## Current Proposals (To Be Discussed)

### 1. Structure: The 4 Gardens
Proposed division of existing content into themed "Gardens":
*   **Garden of Origins (Past):** `OnThisDay` (History/Nostalgia).
*   **Garden of Reason (Present/Mind):** `DidYouKnow` (Science) & `DeepThoughtLibrary` (Philosophy).
*   **Garden of Emotion (Heart):** Music & Personal Connections ("Orang yang gw sayang").
*   **Garden of Becoming (Future):** Manifesto & Projects (The "Event Horizon").

### 2. "2 Perspectives" Clarification
*   **Question:** Does "2 Perspectives" refer to the pairing of *Science* (`DidYouKnow`) vs *History* (`OnThisDay`)? Or is it a new concept?
*   **Context:** User mentioned bundling "Library of Thought" + "2 Perspectives" into a specific garden.

### 3. Visual Experience & Navigation
*   **Question:** Should the user "travel" between isolated rooms/worlds (distinct backgrounds)? Or scroll through one continuous, shifting landscape?
*   **Proposal:** "Warp Drive" effect between sections vs. Parallax Scrolling.

## Decisions & User Direction (Updated)

### 1. The Structure: 5 Pillars (User Decision)
The application will be divided into 5 distinct spaces:

1.  **Open Garden (Portfolio/Professional)**
    *   **Scope:** Public.
    *   **Content:** About, Projects, Changelog (Professional).
    *   **Vibe:** Professional yet cosmic. "The Public Persona".

2.  **Private Garden (The/My Universe)**
    *   **Scope:** Private / Authenticated.
    *   **Content:** Wishlist, Journey, Bookshelf, Movie List, Ideas, TIL.
    *   **Vibe:** "Me Time".

3.  **Garden of the Angel (The Sanctuary)**
    *   **Scope:** Shared / Intimate.
    *   **Content:** Letters, Support System, Time Capsules.

4.  **The Museum (The Archive of Existence)**
    *   **Scope:** Public (Detached from Persona).
    *   **Content:** Pure Knowledge. Science, Politics, History Timelines.
    *   **Philosophy:** "Showcasing the Universe itself".

5.  **The Engine Room (Meta Garden)**
    *   **Scope:** Public/Meta.
    *   **Content:** Tech Stack, App Version History, Feature Journey.
    *   **Philosophy:** "How this universe was built".

### 2. Homepage Concept
*   The Homepage is **not a feed**. It is a **Gateway/Map** to these gardens.
*   It should display the entry points to these worlds.

### 3. Visuals
*   Each garden has special characteristics but follows a unified design identity.

## Brainstorming: Garden Expansion Features

### A. The Open Garden (Public)
*   **Constellation of Works:** Transform the project/portfolio section into a star map. Clicking a star opens the case study.
*   **Signal Receiver:** A unique "Guestbook". Visitors don't just comment; they "send a signal" or "plant a seed".
*   **Cosmic Radio:** A curated public playlist (distinct from the personal emotional one).

### B. The Secret Garden (Private)
*   **The Void:** A text input for venting that permanently deletes the text upon submission. Catharsis.
*   **Energy Metronome:** A private tracker of the author's current "Social Battery" or mood. Could subtly tint the public site's background color.
*   **Dream Log:** Dedicated space for recording abstract dreams.

### C. The Garden of the Angel (Intimate)
*   **Memory Constellation:** An interactive timeline of shared moments/photos.
*   **The Promise:** A static, sworn manifesto/vow to the person.
*   **Synchronicity:** Real-time indicator (symbolic) or "Thought of you" counter.

### D. New Garden Proposals
*   **The Engine Room:** A meta-garden showing the code/tech health. "The mechanics of the universe".
*   **Interstellar Terminal:** A curated list of links to other personal sites (friends/inspiration). "Warp gates to other universes".
